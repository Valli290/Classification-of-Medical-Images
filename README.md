# Classification-of-Medical-Images

This project uses deep learning to classify medical images into "Normal" or "Diseased" categories. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on labeled image data to assist in early diagnosis by automating image-based analysis. Ideal for prototyping intelligent diagnostic tools in healthcare and biomedical research.
